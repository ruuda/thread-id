# v5.0.0

Released 2024-10-22.

This release contains no functional changes compared to v4.2.2. Users who have
no issues with the `winapi` crate are not advised to update.

**Compatibility:**

 * The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.60.0.
   (This requirement is imposed by the `windows-sys` crate.)

Changes:

 * Replace the `winapi` dependency with `windows-sys`. They are functionally
   equivalent, however `windows-sys` is published first-party by Microsoft.
   ([#19][19])
 * Uses Rust edition 2021 rather than 2015.
 * CI configuration is now generated with [RCL](https://rcl-lang.org/),
   to make it easier to bump the MSRV in the future.
 * Ensures compatibility with Rust 1.60.0 through 1.82.0.

# v4.2.1

Released 2023-10-16.

 * Remove Redox-specific dependencies in favor of the `libc` crate, in
   accordance [with Redox' ABI stability plans][redox-abi]. This makes Redox
   use the same pthreads calls as the other Unix-like platforms. ([#15][15])
 * Ensures compatibility with Rust 1.34.2 through 1.73.0.

# v3.1.0

Released 2017-05-13.

 * Add the MIT license as an alternative to the Apache 2.0 license. This license
   change applies retroactively to all versions, this is only a metadata change.

# v3.0.0

Released 2016-10-29.

 * Depend on libc only on Unix-like environments, and on kernel32-sys only
   on Windows. This requires Rust 1.8 or later, hence the major version
   bump.

   This is a breaking change.
